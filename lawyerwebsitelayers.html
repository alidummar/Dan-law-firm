                            Business and Employment Laws encompass everyone in the workplace and the laws governing the employer/employee rights and privileges. Mr. Dümmar understands that the focus of a business owner should be to try to use these laws to their benefit, to improve culture, efficiency, and profit. These include, but are not limited to:
                            Proper Policy Handbooks
                            Discrimination (e.g. Harassment)
                            Non-Compete Agreements
                            Hiring, Firing, and Wrongful Termination
                            Worker’s Compensation
                            FMLA, FLSA, and the ADAAA
                            ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act)
                            OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration)
                            Successfully advised and defended business owners involved in employment-related issues involving discrimination, sexual harassment, workers compensation, termination and severance, non-compete agreements, FMLA disputes, and wrongful termination suits.

                            Strategically helped clients make innovative legal decisions to improve the bottom line, protect clients' assets from creditors, and improve the overall health of companies.
                            Successfully navigated business owners through audits by the Federal Wage and Hour Division in a case involving over $500,000 in fines and penalties (2008).

                            With respect to time share cancellations, we represent timeshare owners that are struggling to make payments or are victims of fraud. Many people have not calculated the true cost of owning a timeshare. Legitimate timeshare purchases do occur, but we understand that many times, the timeshare representatives/salesperson have to tell you material misrepresentations in order to get you to even consider making the purchase of their timeshare. We know that you rely on what they say on making the purchase, then you find out after the rescission period that it wasn’t like the representative/salesperson said it was.
