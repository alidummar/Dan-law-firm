                    <p id="paragraph">I am Dan C. Dümmar, a dedicated attorney and shareholder at Beard St. Clair Gaffney. With a passion for the law and a commitment to delivering innovative solutions to my clients, I specialize in various legal areas, including Business and Employment Law, Health Care Law, Estate Planning, and Family Law. My legal practice covers both transactional and litigation aspects, ensuring comprehensive support for my clients' needs.

                        My educational background includes a Juris Doctorate degree from the University of Idaho and a Master's Degree from Ohio University. I am licensed to practice in Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming, with the privilege of representing clients before the Federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Additionally, I have been appointed as a Parenting Coordinator for the State of Idaho, further underscoring my dedication to the legal profession.
                        
                        Beyond my legal career, I am proud to contribute to the academic world as an adjunct faculty member at Brigham Young University-Idaho, where I have the privilege of educating future legal professionals.
                        
                        In my personal life, I have been happily married for over two decades. I bring the same passion I have for the law to my interests outside the office, including my previous role as a college soccer coach for Brigham Young University – Hawaii (NCAA). I also enjoy engaging in various sports and recreational activities, rounding out my diverse and fulfilling life experiences.</p>
